LBRY is an open-source protocol providing distribution, discovery, and purchase of digital content (data) via a decentralized network. It utilizes the [LBRY blockchain](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd) as a global namespace and database of digital content. Blockchain entries contain searchable content metadata, identities, and rights and access rules. LBRY also provides a data network that consists of peers uploading and downloading data from other peers, possibly in exchange for payments, and a distributed hash table, used by peers to discover other peers.

This project aims to provide a daemon that can interact with the network via a json-rpc interface over HTTP.

The project is written in Python 3.7+ and extensively uses Twisted framework.

Our [releases page](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/releases) contains pre-built binaries of the latest release, pre-releases, and past releases, for macOS, Debian-based Linux, and Windows.

## Usage

Run `lbrynet start` to launch the daemon.

By default, `lbrynet` will provide a JSON-RPC server at `http://localhost:5279`. It is easy to interact with via cURL or sane programming languages.

Our [quickstart guide](http://lbry.io/quickstart) provides a simple walkthrough and examples for learning.

The full API is documented [here](https://lbryio.github.io/lbry/cli).

## Running from source

Installing from source is also relatively painless, full instructions are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
