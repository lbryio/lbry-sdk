######### KADEMLIA CONSTANTS ###########

#: Small number Representing the degree of parallelism in network calls
alpha = 3

#: Maximum number of contacts stored in a bucket; this should be an even number
k = 8

#: Maximum number of contacts stored in the replacement cache
replacementCacheSize = 8

#: Timeout for network operations (in seconds)
rpcTimeout = 5

# number of rpc attempts to make before a timeout results in the node being removed as a contact
rpcAttempts = 5

# Delay between iterations of iterative node lookups (for loose parallelism)  (in seconds)
iterativeLookupDelay = rpcTimeout / 2

#: If a k-bucket has not been used for this amount of time, refresh it (in seconds)
refreshTimeout = 3600  # 1 hour
#: The interval at which nodes replicate (republish/refresh) data they are holding
replicateInterval = refreshTimeout
# The time it takes for data to expire in the network; the original publisher of the data
# will also republish the data at this time if it is still valid
dataExpireTimeout = 86400  # 24 hours

tokenSecretChangeInterval = 300  # 5 minutes

peer_request_timeout = 10

######## IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFIC CONSTANTS ###########

#: The interval in which the node should check its whether any buckets need refreshing,
#: or whether any data needs to be republished (in seconds)
checkRefreshInterval = refreshTimeout / 5

#: Max size of a single UDP datagram, in bytes. If a message is larger than this, it will
#: be spread across several UDP packets.
udpDatagramMaxSize = 8192  # 8 KB
